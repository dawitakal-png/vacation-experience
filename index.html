    <h1>Picture Perfect Trip: Vacation in Amsterdam</h1>

    <h2>Where would you go?</h2>
    <p>
        If I could take a vacation, I would travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands during the summer.
        The city is known for its historic canals, colorful houses, and rich cultural history.
        I would visit the Anne Frank House, the Van Gogh Museum, and the Rijksmuseum to experience
        world-class art and history. Walking and biking along the canal belt would allow me to
        see the city from a local’s perspective (Iamsterdam, n.d.).

    <h2>What would you do?</h2>
    <p>
        During my vacation, I would enjoy activities that combine relaxation and adventure.
        I would explore the city by water, bike through historic neighborhoods, and walk through
        local markets to experience everyday life in Amsterdam (Iamsterdam, n.d.).

        <li>Take a canal cruise through the city</li>
        <li>Ride a bike along Amsterdam’s streets</li>
        <li>Visit Albert Cuyp Market for shopping</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>What would you eat?</h2>
    <p>
        Sampling local cuisine would be one of the highlights of my trip. I would enjoy
        poffertjes, which are small fluffy pancakes, and stroopwafels filled with sweet caramel.
        I would also try Dutch cheese, herring, and other popular street foods while exploring
        the city (DutchAmsterdam, 2023).
